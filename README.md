Machine_Learning_bias_Variance_trade_off.R:
“Bias and variance are complements of each other” The increase of one will result in the decrease of the other and vice versa. Hence, finding the right balance of values is known as the Bias-Variance Tradeoff. An ideal algorithm should neither underfit nor overfit the data. (Google)
